# DSA
My Java solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by data structures and algorithms.

# 🧩 LeetCode Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms problems** implemented in **Java**.  
I’m organizing problems by **topic (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hashing, Dynamic Programming, etc.)** so it’s easy to navigate and revise.  



Got it 👍 let’s make your **main repo README** look clean, minimal, and professional (GitHub-style).
Here’s a redesigned version (copy–paste fully):
